**Mood:** Excited! I hope I can pull this off...

**Thoughts:** I started coding using javascript on Friday. Will be useful for adding bolt ons to Google Apps at work (University of Sheffield). One of the projects I would like to work on is creating an attendance system that uses Google Apps Script to take a barcode reader input and create an attendance register for students in Google Sheets. However, this feels a bit daunting at the moment! Although the basic building blocks are 1. Barcode reader reads barcode directly into Google Sheet 2. Google Sheet looks up unique identifier 3. Google sheet marks student present if unique identifier found. 3. Google Sheet marks student absent if unique identifier not found. Instructor can add absence reason.

It would also be good to add extra options to Google Forms. Possibly a project where a Google Form once used creates an email, calendar event and adds to a Google Sheet.

Also - what can Javascript do for a Google Site?
